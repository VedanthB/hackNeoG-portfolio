## How to deploy the project ??

- RUN¬†`npm run build`, in the frontend folder,  this command will update the `public` folder for you
- DRAG AND DROP the `public` folder on Netlify, your app is live now for the world to see.
- One last step to make the website load data from Sanity is adding the deployed site link in the cors origin tab on the sanity manage dashboard.
